# FantasyPlanner
Web application that will allow anyone to create and organize a complete fantasy story!

Note: Development is in the very early stages and will be for quite some time.

Reference Text 

Clickable (Ctrl+Click) text that links to the reference material. 

Ex: User defines a location and references it in a character bio. User can click on the reference in the character bio to go directly to the definition of the location. 

 

Comprehensive Manager 

Easily create every aspect of a story and its universe. 

Thorough options for every piece of the story so that you can be as brief or as detailed as you want. 

 

No Option? Add an Option! 

If a drop down doesn't include an option you need or want, then you can create a new "Definition" for it! 

 

Story Assistant 

Non-intrusive assistant that keeps you on track and keeps you from falling into tunnel vision or from forgetting important details. 

Upon creating an object, the assistant will create a to-do list involving the object. 

Example: User creates a world.  

Assistant creates a to-do list for that world. 

Who lives here? 

What is the condition of that place? 

Are there any significant events that happened here? 

And so on… 

User manually checks each item as skipped or complete. 

Can be disabled.

Generic Objects

Update once, change everywhere! You can make a change to generic objects and have all connected objects be updated as well!

Modify permissions (Recommended for large organizations). 

Send messages to Users. 

 

User Prioritized Options 

100% anonymous data is sent to us so that we can determine which descriptions, definitions, and features are used the most often. We use this information so that we can better organize Fantasy Planner to enhance the user experience. 

The more often a feature is used, the higher up on the list it goes!
